1. What is Jenkins?
    Jenkins = Automation server (open source).
    Core use: Automating CI/CD pipelines.
             CI → Continuous Integration (merge & test code regularly).
             CD → Continuous Delivery/Deployment (automatically deploy apps).
        
    Jenkins does tasks like:
        Pull code from GitHub
        Run tests automatically
        Build Docker images
        Deploy to servers
        Send notifications

2. Jenkins Architecture

Understanding the structure is crucial:

🏗️ Jenkins Core Components

i. Jenkins Master (Controller)
    The “brain” of Jenkins.
    Responsibilities:
        -Scheduling jobs.
        -Distributing builds to agents.
        -Monitoring builds.
        -Storing configuration.

ii. Jenkins Agent (Slave/Worker Node)
    Executes the jobs assigned by the master.
    Useful when you need different environments (Linux, Windows, etc.).

iii. Jenkins Plugins
    Jenkins by itself is lightweight.
    Functionality is extended by plugins (Git, Docker, Slack, Kubernetes, etc.).

3. Installing Jenkins

You can install Jenkins in 3 main ways:

i. Direct install:
    Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
        sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
        sudo apt update
        wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
        sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install jenkins -y

    Then start with sudo systemctl start jenkins.

ii. Docker (recommended for practice):

        docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins:lts
        Access: http://localhost:8080

iii. Windows:
        Download ".msi" installer from jenkins.io
